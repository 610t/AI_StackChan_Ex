![](../images/gpt4o_camera.jpg)

As shown in this photo, you can capture an object with the camera, touch the forehead and start a conversation, allowing you to ask questions such as "What is this?"

> This function is ON by default, but if you want to turn it OFF, touch the camera image on the LCD. The camera image will no longer be displayed and you will be able to talk normally without image input.
